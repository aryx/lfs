You can use glimpse in conjonction with LFS.
It allows to make from LFS queries such as cd glimpse:toto.
 (and LFS internally issues a    glimpse -l -y -i -H . toto)

You have first to make the index, by issueing the command
 index_LFS_with_glimpse
from the directory where reside LFS meta-data.
Then the indexing of new files created under LFS is automatic.

Glimpse normally index text files, but we can also index binary
or more complex files if we know how to handle them.
We just have to convert such files in text files. For instance
it is easy to transform a pdf into a text file with the command
pdftotext. So, to extend the glimpse capability, just modifiy
the index_LFS_with_glimpse.ml file to add more converters.
