A big thanks to Olivier Ridoux and Sebastien Ferré for all their work
around LIS and LFS.

Thanks to
  * Vincenzo Ciancia for the OCaml binding to the Fuse library,
  * Lex Stein for the OCaml binding to Berkeley DB,
  * Sebastien Ferré for his implementation in OCaml of a suffix tree library, and for his logic functors (logfun).

  * Richard Jones for his dumper module,
  * Brian Hurt and Nicolas Cannasse for their dynArray module,
  * Troestler Christophe for his ANSITerminal module,

Thanks to the teams behind Berkeley DB and Fuse.

Thanks of course also to Stallman, Linus, Leroy, Knuth and their
acolytes for respectively Emacs, Linux, OCaml, and (La)Tex.
