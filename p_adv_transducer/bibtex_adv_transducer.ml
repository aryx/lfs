(* TODO better use of the keyword=  field cos can be on more than one lines,
   in fact same pb for other entries => perhaps better pack pre processing (gather some lines)

 bug: if author is 'michand Brandt' => je vois le and :) faut des \b dans le split
*)
(* better domain:
    use classification=  (cf 100_000.bib for example)
    try do as in bibtex (suppr a/of/in/for/with/on, try make complex domain), split [ \t:], or have a dictionnary? (take acm classification)
    inspire bibtex2html ? have tricks to infer from title ?
