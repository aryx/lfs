Add the following packages (for instance using the command 'apt-get
install <packagename>) :

 - ocaml
 - camlidl

 - libdb4.3
 - libdb4.3-dev
 - db4.3-util

 - libfuse2
 - fuse-utils. note: debconf ask to choose a group, the default is
   fuse, it seems that you should not change this value otherwise then
   fusermount is not made setuid and then LFS can not work.
 - libfuse-dev


You can compile the fuse kernel module, but nowadays the kernels of
most distributions directly support fuse so the following step is
optional.

So if you really want to compile yourself the fuse
kernel module install first:
 - module-assistant
 - kernel-headers-2.4.27 (or kernel-headers-2.4.27-2-386  or similar)

then install:
 - fuse-source

then issue as root the (cryptic) command:
 m-a a-i  fuse

You have to add yourself in the "fuse" group (edit /etc/group) to be
able to access to fusermount program and you have to relog (check that
you are indeed in the fuse group by running the "/usr/bin/groups"
command)

If you want other users on your machine to access your mounted fuse
filesystem then you can optionaly create a file /etc/fuse.conf and add
the following line
    user_allow_other
You must then relaunch (or launch) fuse with
the command  "rmmod fuse; modprobe fuse".



You can now detar the source of LFS and type the make command.



To enable some LFS plugins, you can install:
 - libmp3-info-perl
 - libmp3-tag-perl
 - vorbis-tools

 - glimpse. there is no debian package for this. You have to install
   it from source. Note that you don't need it absolutly, because
   plugins, and this one in particular, are optional.

 - gprolog

To enable the GUI for mp3 and photos provided with LFS, install:
 - lablgtk
   warning: the lablgtk package as some point conflicted with the berkeley db
   development package (libdb4.3-dev) so then you needed to first compile
   the LFS source (requiring the libdb4.3-dev package), and then install
   the lablgtk package and compile the GUI (LFS binaries dont need the
   libdb4.3-dev package to run (but need it to compile)) and then take care
   then to reinstall libdb4.3-dev if you want to recompile LFS.
