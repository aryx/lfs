====== LFS versus other tools ======

===== LFS vs unix 'find' =====

===== LFS vs unix 'locate' =====

===== LFS vs Apple Spotlight =====

It's not a filesystem so you can not use some traditionnal tools over
Spotlight queries. The navigation capabilities of Spotlight are also
limited. But, but, they have an amazing GUI. Spotlight is really a
nice software.

===== LFS vs Beagle FS (and beagle) =====

From the beagle FAQ: http://beagle-project.org/FAQ
"How can I just search within a directory?"

"This is not well implemented because Beagle is trying to remove the
boundaries between directories! To this end, the main Beagle front-end
does allow a directory to be selected. That said, if you search within
the Nautilus GUI (using the Beagle extensions) you can choose a
starting directory for the search.
"

This problem does not exist in LFS because LFS considers directories as properties
too and is not just a finding tool, you can also navigate. Once you want
to care about directories, about navigation, then it's not as simple as
beagleFS which is just a frontend to beagle (but a nice one).
