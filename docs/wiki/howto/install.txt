To install LFS you need to build it from the source.
===== Installing on Gentoo =====
It depends on several packages:
^Package ^ ^
| ocaml | The language in which lfs is coded. ocaml is needed to compile the source. |
| camlidl | Needed to use C code from fuse, etc. |
| db | Berkeley Database used to store all the metadata of the files. |
| gdbm | Standard GNU database libraries. |
| fuse | The interface for the filesystem. |
These packages are the needed by lfs to work, but you may install several packages more to generate metadata from these file types. These are plugins for LFS.
^File type ^Packages ^
| mp3 | MP3-Info, MP3-Tags, Compress-Zlib |
| ogg | vorbis-tools |
If you want a GUI interface for your mp3 files and photos you need to install the package **lablgtk**.

With new versions of fuse, you need to build the fuse module in the kernel, and then, install the fuse package. If it were your case, emerging fuse should fail.
You have to set File-systems -> Filesystem in Userspace support (AKA FUSE) to be a module. After that, build your new module and install it with:
   make modules modules_install
Then load it
   modprobe fuse
And you should be able to emerge fuse as usual.

The ebuild for LFS is on [[http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise|Sunrise overlay]] in the //sys-fs// category.
You just need to use layman and add the overlay and then:
   emerge sys-fs/lfs
You can also select the USE flags for the plugins you want to use.
Once installed, you need to create a folder for your metadata database and a mount point to mount your LFS.
   mkdir /tmp/meta-lfs /tmp/lfs
And then you have to generate the metadata database with:
   build-db.opt -build_db_gentoo /tmp/meta-lfs
This can take several minutes depending on how much files you have in your hard drive. It shows the progress in this format
   PARSING: ... (done/total)
After the database of metadata has been created you have to mount your filesystem. There are several modes.
=== Semi-real mode ===
In semi-real mode your filesystem is not changed, it is read only and provides you another way to browse your files making queries but makes no changes in your filesystem.
   mount.lfs -semi_real_mode /tmp/meta-lfs /tmp/lfs
If it gets blocked on some queries, you may use the ''-timeout'' option to ''mount.lfs'' so it stops after the given seconds.
Now you can browse your LFS filesystem with the lfs query sintax like:
   ls /tmp/lfs/.best

To unmount your filesystem you can do:
   fusermount -u /tmp/lfs
If you need to kill lfs for any reason you can run:
   pkill -9 mount.lfs
This may corrupt the LFS metadata so you may have to generate it again.
