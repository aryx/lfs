When you build your meta data with the -build_db_gentoo option, /var/db/pkg/*/CONTENTS files are read and generates information for each file in each package. (CONTENTS files are one per package and they contain the files each package include). It makes possible to browse files per package or category, for example:

    cd /lfs/category:sys-fs/package:lfs/usr
    This will show you all the files of the package lfs, in the category sys-fs that are in /usr.

    cd /lfs/package:lfs/ext:h/.ext
    This will show you all the .h files inside the lfs package, if we don't restrict to the sys-fs category it will show both .h files of sys-fs/lfs
    and of app-doc/lfs (Linux from scratch).

    cd /lfs/category:sys-fs/usr/include
    This will show all the files inside /usr/include (technically /include/usr too) that come from packages in the sys-fs category.


Note: /lfs represents your LFS filesystem mount point.
