------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 3 versions and 3 ways to use LFS:

 - The application version of LFS. This version is not a filesystem
   but a normal application which provides a shell interface to test
   the functionnality of LFS. This version is far easier to install,
   but far less interesting from the user point of view because it is
   not a filesystem.

 - The full filesystem version of LFS. This version is a real filesystem, 
   which give access to the advantages of a filesystem, allowing the user to:
    - store real datas (such as music files, programs, ...),
    - use a real shell providing advanced features (such as completion, 
      globbing, ...),
    - use traditional application over LFS (such as mp3 player, emacs, 
      explorer, ...),
   This version is more difficult to install as it requires to work
   with the Linux kernel. 

 - The filesystem version of LFS as a "semi-real" filesystem where LFS
   just acts as a wrapper giving another view of your current
   hierarchical filesystem. This version is a real filesystem and also
   give access to the advantages of a filesystem, but it operates in a
   different way than the previous mode. It provides a smooth path to
   benefit of some of the advantages of LFS (powerful query and
   navigation) without chaning anything to the way you organize your
   current data. The drawback is that you can not benefit of some of
   the advantages of LFS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

A strong requirement for installing LFS is to use a Linux machine, and
to be allowed to install a kernel module (which means root access).
Nowadays this kernel module, fuse.ko, is present in almost all distributions
so you just need to be able to use the fuse utilities.
Note that LFS can also be installed as a user level application, but
this type of install offers much less services; it must be reserved
for playing with LFS ideas. In this case, the only requirement is that
OCaml, a functional programming language, is available on the platform
(most are, including Microsoft Windows and MacOS X).

To install LFS from source you will also need to install some packages such as
kernel-headers, the gcc/binutils toolsuite, ...



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install:

   configure 
   make depend
   make
   make coredemo

 If the configure script tells you that some packages are missing, you
 can install them by picking in lfs-dependencies.tgz, available on the
 LFS website, which provides the source of those required external
 libraries/tools used by LFS. The installation procedure for most of
 those packages are either to run the commands "configure; make; make
 install" or the commands "perl Makefile.PL; make; make install".

 The preceding commands allows to install the application version of
 LFS, and you can already play with LFS with this version. If you dont
 want to install the filesystem version and play only with the
 application version, just launch the LFS interpreter coredemo.top.
 You will need some knowledge of ocaml. The file demo.ml contains
 examples of interaction.

 To compile the filesystem version (real and semi-real mode) type: 
     make all
 but you have first to install Fuse. You can either:
  FIXME

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use:

  The path "/your/meta_data_place" represents in the following a place
   on your hard disk where you want to store the LFS meta data.

  Run the command: touch /your/meta_data_place/lfs_secu

  This command is required because some commands such as mkfs.lfs or
  build-db requires before allocating its structure to be sure that it
  will not erase the data of the user unintentionnaly. So before
  proceeding check that /your/meta_data_place does not contain
  important information.



To use of the semi real mode of LFS (most people will want that):

  The first time you use LFS, you have to initialise LFS meta-data with:
     cd LFS-0.5/
     source env.sh
     ./build-db.opt -lfs_metapath /your/meta_date_place  /path/that/you/want/to/index 

  Then to "mount" LFS run the command:
     ./mount.lfs -semi_real_mode /your/meta_data_place /your/mount_point/
     cd /your/mount_point/
     ls

  Use the following command for unmounting LFS: 
       fusermount -u /your/mount_point/





To use the real mode of LFS (most people will prefer the safer semi-real mode):

  The first time you use LFS, you have to initialise LFS with:
    mkfs.lfs /your/meta_data_place/

  Then you can use LFS:

   run the command:
      mount.lfs -real_mode /your/meta_data_place /your/mount_point/; 
      cd /your/mount_point/
   Use the command: 
       umount.lfs /your/mount_point/ for unmounting.

  Example of session:
   mkdir a
   mkdir b
   mkdir c
   touch a/b/fab 
   touch c/b/fbc
   cd b
   ls 
      --> see a/ c/
   cd a
   ls 
      --> see fab
