* LFS 0.5
----------
** Features:
 - semi real mode enabling to use LFS without using LFS :). LFS just acts
   as a wrapper over your classical hierarchical fs. For now there 
   is only ext:, size:, name:, date:, and dir: as intrinsic properties and 
   some date and string logic.
 - date:yesterday special property

** Internal:
 - reorganize the code. More .mli, cleaner interfaces, less dependencies. 
   Also make it easier to use the core of LFS (useful for my other CComment 
   project)


* LFS 0.4
----------

** Features:
 - better support for date by using a logic solver 
   (made using logfun by Sebastien Ferré)
 - a cd .nojump/ new special command.

** Bug-fixes:
 - correctly update the true extension, when rm file that have no property.
   Thanks to Rix Beck to point out this bug.

** Internal:
 - include the logfun library by Sebastien Ferré to implement more easily
   some logic solvers by combining simpler logic solvers. 


* 0.4beta2
----------

** Features:
 - add some support for date. very basic. 
      * have a new 'date:' property  handled by a system transducer
      * have a "dynamic property" 'date:today' that translates into going 
        to the current day
 - add some options to mount.lfs (such as -fsckshowprogress)
 
** Finalize old features:
 - allow delete and mv "ambiguous" filename (the one containing <xx>)
   => that allows to mv easily a big set of files,  and so add or del a 
      property to a big set of files.
     just do  cd .ext; mv * <newpath>
 - stree: (which is also all:) properties are now up to date.
 - glimpse: properties are now also up to date ("a la spotlight"). 
   kind of incremental indexing. I use grep to search recent files, 
   a secondary glimpseindex to search less recent files, and the primary
   glimpseindex to search the really old files.
 - the cache of the dynamic properties are invalidated when necessary, so the
   content of directory such as glimpse:xxx is recomputed when necessary, 
   and always up to date.
 - log files of berkeley DB are now deleted automatically. I do some 
   checkpoint regularily.

** Bug-fixes:
 - make some functions (assoc#iter and assoc#length) tail call or more
   efficient. fsck now works better in native mode (but still wierd).
 - fix problem when create file with strange names such as toto$1.txt 
   or -toto.txt.


** Internal:
 - have reorganized the source. have added more .mli files.



* 0.4beta1
----------

** Features:
 - when .ca, now also gather in x&y&z if x, y, z are "equivalent" 
   (lead do same set of files), so better navigation experience 
   (avoid also to implement a little the .goint)
 - versionning by default. at each save (only for .txt for the moment 
   (can be customized))
 - when rm,  in fact mv in meta-lfs/lost+found/  
   (do same as what fsck do when pb)
 - when there is multiple files with same name in same dir, append to some
   of them a <xx> as emacs do  with buffer to allow disambiguate them
 - can now get inode number  via hardlink count  (do ls -l to see it )
 - can now use cd .int to get intension of a file. for the moment work
   only with one file at a time and return only the extrinsic property. 
   In futur will be able with the same command to get also the intension 
   of a set of files (of a pwd) 
 - export import (available in scripts/). indeed, with inode:xx, 
   with disambiguation (via <xxx>), with .int 
     => can now have import export
    allow to cp some files from one lfs mountpoint to another lfs mountpoint. 
 - can now create files in disjunction/negation/special  dir, 
   => can create file even in google:xxx 
 - add few features to lfs-tunes (keep the random order history)


** Bug-fixes:
 - when  mv  filename,  need update some intrinsic property (name:xxx) 
   and so call transducers (at least system transducers)

 - I have added  . and .. in ls listing,  cos some tools still except 
   and use those entries, for instance cp xx ..  didnt work before 
   this fix under LFS 




* LFS 0.3:
---------

** First really public release.

** Switch to Fuse (and specially OcamlFuse), so now almost everything
  is in Caml.

** Features:
 - a GUI for playing music files: lfs-tunes
 - integrate glimpse and suffix tree for some special request
 - add support for relation (with ln command)

** Bug-fixes:

** Robustness:
 - put back berkeley db and so transactions.

** Optimisations:
 - fast logic (at least :) ) now can really be called a _logic_ file system.

** Plugins:

** Misc:
 - easier install because of Fuse.




* LFS 0.2:
---------

** Switch to Ocaml (but still with a PerlFS part)

** change model, have a smoother interface 
   for plug-ins (logics and transducers)
   for inter- and intra-file navigation

** faster (in part because of OCaml)

* LFS 0.1:
--------

** cf my history.txt


* LFS beta:
----------

** change model

* LFS alpha:
-----------

** in Perl (so real fs with help of PerlFS, but ugly because Perl)

* LFS pre-alpha: 
---------------

** in Caml (but no fs)


-------------------------------------
* Done by other before LFS pre-alpha:
-------------------------------------
** LIS prototype in lambda-prolog (by Sebastien Ferré)
** RFS prototype in C (by master students of Olivier Ridoux)
