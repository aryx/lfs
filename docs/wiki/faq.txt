==== Use ====

=== Can we run utilies in LFS directories, like grep ? ===

Yes you can. You can run all commands, like:

    $ grep kmalloc '/lfs/ext:c/drivers|net/.ext/'*.c

The only limitations for the default mode of LFS ("semi real mode") is
that you can only edit or read the contents of files. You can not delete, or
move files around. For that thing you will have to do those actions under your traditional
filesystem, not under the LFS view of your traditional filesystem.

=== What if a query contain files with the same name ? ===

LFS will append some (virtual) <xx> suffix to the files, as in

    $ ls /lfs/ext:txt/.ext/
    foo.txt bar.txt TODO.txt  TODO<1>.txt   TODO<2>.txt ...


==== Misc ====

=== How much space use LFS meta-data ? ===

For my homedir, 180 000 files (=~ 40Go), the meta-data takes
only 123Mo (so 0.3%).
