a |= b means that 'a' is more specialised than 'b', 'a' is an instance
of 'b', ...

Writing solver for complex domain is tedious, dont want to handle X*X
possible combinaisons for each form that can take X => canonic form,
try reduce to less forms (eliminate sugar, ...).

Be methodic in the X*X comparaisons, start from the most specific
formula to the more general (the last clause should be a comparaison
between 2 general formulas).

Pas oblige de tout mettre dans solver, peut utiliser axiomes par
exemple pour avoir du sucre. par ex faisant de la propriété
size:>100Mo une sous-propriété de sizebis:Big



update: note that the interface have changed and so solver take their
 formula from STDIN, that means that you must flush your answers,
 otherwise LFS is waiting forever the answer via the pipe


update: don't have to be complete. Can make useful solver 
that do not order completely formula between them.
